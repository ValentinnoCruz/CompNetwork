These are the lines for nodeC.nc:

//this code allows each node to interface with the sample module
components sampleC as sampleMod;
Node.sampleMod -> sampleMod;

These are the lines for node.nc:

//this line allows code in node to use the commands provided by the sampleModule
uses interface sampleModule as sampleMod;

To show calling the test function, optionally add these lines inside event void booted()

bool testSampleModule = 0;
testSampleModule = call sampleMod.sampleFunction();
